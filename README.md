# Context as an injection engine

As context has become pretty much a first class citizen in the react eco system, this is just a test bed where I am fiddling with it as an injector for relatively dump data such as themes. 

## Goals

1. Trial sCU block work arounds
2. Trial minor updates to context even tho not advised. 
3. Trial immutability for state behind context

### As most of the test setups built with CRA
 
Future tests if the concept works may be to trial context into react native.
